Title: Movie Recommendation System - Machine Learning Approach

This readme provides a brief overview and instructions on executing the Python code provided in 'main.py', which is part of a project focusing on improving movie recommendation systems using traditional machine learning techniques.

1. Overview:
The 'main.py' python script is designed to load a sample dataset (sample_dataset.csv), clean the data, split it into training and testing datasets, train different machine learning classifiers, make predictions on the testing dataset, and print the accuracy of each classifier.

2. Requirements:
To execute the script, make sure you have a Python environment set up with required libraries installed. The libraries used in the script include:
- pandas
- sklearn

3. Running the Script:
To run the script, use a command-line interface. Navigate to the directory where your 'main.py' file resides, then type and enter the following command:
```
python main.py
```
You would then see printed outputs indicating the accuracy of the different classifiers.

4. Dataset Info:
The sample_dataset.csv contains assumed fields like ['userId', 'movieId', 'ratings', 'age', 'occupation', 'gender']. We could consider 'age', 'occupation', and 'gender' as features that influence 'ratings'. The 'userId' and 'movieId' fields can be considered identifiers.

5. NOTE: 
This is a simple implementation and requires a proper setup Python environment. Depending on your actual dataset, additional data cleaning, feature engineering, or model tuning may be required for effective results.

6. Link for Original Dataset:
The original dataset that this project is based on is a subset of the MovieLens dataset freely available at Kaggle. Here is the link to the original dataset:
